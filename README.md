# Odin Recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipe pages, demonstrating fundamental HTML skills.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in:

- **HTML structure and semantics**: Creating well-structured HTML documents with proper use of elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- **HTML links**: Using anchor tags to create navigation between pages within a website
- **HTML lists**: Implementing both ordered and unordered lists to organize recipe ingredients and instructions
- **HTML images**: Embedding and displaying images with proper alt attributes for accessibility
- **File organization**: Structuring a multi-page website with organized directories and file naming conventions
- **Git workflow**: Using Git for version control, including commits with meaningful messages and pushing to GitHub

This project serves as a foundation for web development skills and will be expanded upon in future projects with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.
